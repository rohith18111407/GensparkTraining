/*
Phase 7: Transactions & Atomicity

Write a transaction block that:

* Enrolls a student
* Issues a certificate
* Fails if certificate generation fails (rollback)

*/
```sql
BEGIN;
-- insert into enrollments
-- insert into certificates
-- COMMIT or ROLLBACK on error
```

SELECT * FROM enrollments WHERE student_id = 2 AND course_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM certificates WHERE serial_no = 'CERT-004';


-- Successful Transaction Block

BEGIN;
-- Insert into enrollments
WITH inserted_enrollment AS (
  INSERT INTO enrollments (student_id, course_id)
