# Abstract Factory Pattern in C#

This project demonstrates the **Abstract Factory Design Pattern** in C#. It provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. The pattern is particularly useful when a system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
