•  Routing
•	Main route: /products — displays product listing.
•	Child route: /products/:id — displays product details based on the id (route parameter).
•	Protect both routes using a route guard (canActivate).
•  API Integration
•	Use DummyJSON Products API
o	Example list API: https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=
o	Example detail API: https://dummyjson.com/products/{id}
•  Search
•	Add a search bar to filter products by name.
•	Use debounce (500ms) to reduce API calls as the user types.
•  Infinite Scroll
•	Load more results as the user scrolls.
•	Support pagination using limit and skip parameters.
•  Product Card Display
•	Show product image, title, price, and description.
•	Use card layout with a responsive grid (Angular Material or CSS Grid).
•  Loading & Empty States
•	Show a loader while fetching data.
•	Show a "No results found" message if search returns nothing.
•  Authentication Simulation
•	Store a mock token in localStorage on login.
•	AuthGuard should check the presence of this token to allow route access.
Technical Requirements
•	Use Angular's HttpClient, ActivatedRoute, and Router
•	Use RxJS operators: debounceTime, switchMap, distinctUntilChanged
•	Implement a custom AuthGuard
•	Display error handling for invalid product IDs in detail route
